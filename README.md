# Education:
Sep 2016 ~ Jul 2020
B.E of Computer Science and Engineering (IEEE honored class) in Shanghai Jiao Tong University

Jan 2021 ~ Nov 2022 (expected)
M.S. of Computing in National University of Singapore

## Laboratories and Researches
July 2018 ~ June 2019, in Learning to Represent Group, Cooperative MediaNet Innovation Center, SJTU.
Training contents include basic computer vision knowledge, disentanglement, generative models and open-set recognition.

July 2019 ~ Nov 2019, under supervision of Prof. Yang YANG in BCMI lab, SJTU.
Project: Subcellular localizing of lncRNA (sequence) and fluorescence-stained human protein (image)
* Try various data augmentation methods in the human protein datasets.
* Implement several different strategies for bio-sequence segmentation for comparison to verify the effectiveness of pre-acquired corpus for lncRNA.
* Compare the affinity of bio-sequence and natural language.

Jan 2020 ~ June 2020, under supervision of Dr. Yanyan SHEN in DDST lab, SJTU.
Project: Enhance ProtoNet with Visual-Semantic Embedding
* Proposed and implemented to introduce visual-semantic embedding into few-shot recognition as prior knowledge to improve classification performance. Intuition is to use word embedding of labels to model the affinity of different categories in vector space.

Currently, I'm working with Professor TAN Kian Lee (NUS, School of Computing) on project "Game analytics".
